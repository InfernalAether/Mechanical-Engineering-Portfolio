  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Andrew Huang. I graduated Chaffey College for my Associate's in Engineering back in May of 2025. I am now pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering at San Francisco State University, with the specialty of robotics. This is my portfolio of my projects and experiences as an engineer.</p>
  <p>This page is a little about me. Growing up, I never really understood or knew what I wanted to do when I grew up. I kind of didn't have it figured out, even when I was applying for colleges. I first went through the idea of getting my medical degree, in hopes to become a surgeon. It wasn't until I was about to begin community college that I realized that I wanted to be an engineer. During my primary education years, I was very interested in the math and science subjects versus any other, almost always excelling in this classes. I realized that I love to do anything that relates to how these two connect with each other, which brought me to realization that physics was definitely one of the major science classes that I had fun in. I remember always wanting to fix things that were broken or build things out of whatever I can find in the household, which was mostly legos by the way, and I came to the realization that I can take this passion and turn it into a job, which is engineering. As we develop technologically, I realized that I always wanted to understand these technological advancements and be a part of them, so I decided that I was going to focus on robotics. Engineering classes aren't always so easy for me but I do love them and enjoy seeing how the world really works with engineering.</p>
  <p> Okay, this is a little more about me if you want to get to know me better! I was born in Monterey Park, California. I am a first-generation Chinese-American, born to immigrant parents. I never really knew my parents as they divorced back when I was just a baby and went their separate ways. I was with my dad until I was 8, where he would leave for China and never really come back, so I was left with the care of my aunt and uncle. Growing up, I worked with them in their little stall at the Bel-Air Swap-meet in Bloomington, CA. I basically lived in SoCal my entire life, up until now, and I grew up in a different environment that was NorCal has to offer. I did a few hobbies as a kid, some which I am still interested today, which includes playing the violin, playing and learning tennis, and gaming. Boy, am I a gamer? I loved gaming, it has been a huge part of my life, and introduced me to many people around the world that I was able to call friends and learn from. Tennis has been a huge part of my high school career, as I was varsity tennis my sophomore year and I made a lot of friends and memories because of it. Growing up, I kind of had an unevenful life as my family didn't really travel much and did much, so I just mostly stayed at home or went out with friends. I would eventually try to find other jobs though in order to start making some money for myself, which landed me a job at Michael's. This job didn't really last long as I needed to transfer schools the following month to San Francisco State University. Currently, I am hoping to make more connections here and adapt to the Bay Area lifestyle.</p>
