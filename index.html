  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Andrew Huang. I graduated Chaffey College for my Associate's in Engineering back in May of 2025. I am now pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering at San Francisco State University, with the specialty of robotics. This is my portfolio of my projects and experiences as an engineer.</p>
  <p>This page is a little about me. Growing up, I never really understood or knew what I wanted to do when I grew up. I kind of didn't have it figured out, even when I was applying for colleges. I first went through the idea of getting my medical degree, in hopes to become a surgeon. It wasn't until I was about to begin community college that I realized that I wanted to be an engineer. During my primary education years, I was very interested in the math and science subjects versus any other, almost always excelling in this classes. I realized that I love to do anything that relates to how these two connect with each other, which brought me to realization that physics was definitely one of the major science classes that I had fun in. I remember always wanting to fix things that were broken or build things out of whatever I can find in the household, which was mostly legos by the way, and I came to the realization that I can take this passion and turn it into a job, which is engineering. As we develop technologically, I realized that I always wanted to understand these technological advancements and be a part of them, so I decided that I was going to focus on robotics. Engineering classes aren't always so easy for me but I do love them and enjoy seeing how the world really works with engineering.</p>
